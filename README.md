# Discord Bot

**JDA needs updating currently getting "Received a channel for a guild that isn't a text or voice channel" error**

This bot is a hobby project, meant to help improve my ability to learn an API as well as create a bot I might find useful plus quirky functionally I fancy implementing. This bot makes use of JDA discord API wrapper.

## Commands

### !Ping
Bot will reply "PONG" in the same text channel

### !CurrentTime
Bot will reply with the current time in the same text channel

### !Roll
Must be in the form !Roll'A'd'B' where A and B are positive integers so that A many d'B' dices will be rolled i.e. 2d6 rolls 2 dice with 6 sides. Bot will reply with the result of the dice roll in the same text channel

### !Joke
Bot will reply with a random joke pulled from a text file.

### !CreateTextChannel
Bot will create a new text channel in the discord server

### !PlayTroll
The users will be able to play a rudimentary vision of my troll game (Finished troll project found [here](https://github.com/Haza290/Escape_The_Trolls) in a new text channel by typing directions in the chat box. This is currently quite slow and can have input lag.

## Future Feachers

### BlackJack
Currently being worked on. Will create a new text channel where users can play blackjack against the bot and with other users

### Music
Add music functionality so the bot can play music from several sources in voice chat
